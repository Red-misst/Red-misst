## 🌟 A Little About Me  
I’m  a curious and creative **Web Developer** who loves building web apps that solve real problems.  
I’ve also got a soft spot for **IoT projects**—give me an Arduino, and I’ll create something cool (or at least interesting).  
And when I’m not coding websites or tinkering with gadgets, you’ll find me diving into **algorithmic trading**, using Python and MT5 to create trading bots that (hopefully) beat the markets.
