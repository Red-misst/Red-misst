## 🌟 A Little About Me  
I’m a curious and creative **Web Developer** who loves building web apps that solve real problems.  
I’ve also got a soft spot for **IoT projects**—give me an Arduino, and I’ll create something cool (or at least interesting).  
And when I’m not coding websites or tinkering with gadgets, you’ll find me diving into **algorithmic trading**, using Python and MT5 to create trading bots that (hopefully) beat the markets.

## 📚 My Favorite Projects  
Here are a few projects I’ve had fun working on:   

- **[Blog](https://www.uniapp.store/)**:  
  A blog built with Next.js that simplifies technology and keeps readers up-to-date on the latest trends.  

- **[Trading Bot](https://github.com/Red-misst/mql5)**:  
  A Python bot for MT5 that identifies great trading opportunities using a mix of technical analysis and machine learning.  

- **[Smart Fishpond](https://github.com/Red-misst/fishpond.git)**:  
  An IoT-based solution to monitor and control fishpond environments. This project automates feeding schedules, monitors water quality parameters like pH and temperature, and sends alerts when conditions fall outside ideal ranges—all powered by Arduino and real-time data processing.
